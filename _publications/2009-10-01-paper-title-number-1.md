Measuring the accessibility of each traffic zone to high-speed railway stations can evaluate the ease of the transportation hub in the transportation system. The utility-based model, which captures individual travel behavior and subjective perception, is often used to quantify the travel impedance on accessibility for a given origin–destination pair. However, existing studies neglect the impacts of travel time uncertainty on utility and possible choice set when measuring accessibility, especially in high-timeliness travel (e.g., railway stations or airports). This study proposes a novel integration of the utility-based model and multimodal space–time prism under travel time uncertainty to measure reliable accessibility to high-speed railway stations. First, the reliable multimodal space–time prism is developed to generate a reliable travel mode choice set constrained by travel time budgets. Then, the reliable choice set is integrated into the utility-based model with the utility function derived from a proposed mean–standard deviation logit-based mode choice model. Finally, this study contributes to measuring reliable accessibility within areas from Beijing’s 5th Ring Road to the Beijing South Railway Station. Based on the results, policymakers can effectively evaluate the distribution of transportation resources and urban planning.

The dynamics and randomness of boarding and alighting flow usually lead to unbalanced congestion across multiple carriages of one metro train. Train weighing sensors make it possible to acknowledge each carriage’s weights in real-time, but it is still hard to know the alighting passengers at the next station, making it difficult to organize boarding flow in advance to balance each carriage’s congestion. Moreover, the correlations among multiple carriages strengthen the complexity of alighting flow prediction. This study will adopt the Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (convLSTM) model based on the multichannel features to predict the carriage alighting flow with the consideration of correlations among carriages. Firstly, the historical carriages’ alighting flow is extracted by monitoring the variations of weights caused by the passengers getting on/off carriages based on the train weighing sensors. Then, the convolution operations are used to extract the correlation between carriages in spatial dimensions. Finally, the LSTM model captures the temporal correlations among carriages and predicts the alighting flow of each carriage. Based on the train weighing data, the model is applied and specified in Guangzhou Metro Line 14 where one metro train consists of 6 carriages. The results show that the proposed model has better performance than other deep learning methods and the model that considers the adjacent carriages’ correlations performs best.
